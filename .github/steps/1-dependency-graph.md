## Step 1: Review and add dependencies using dependency graph

**What's the big deal about securing your repository's supply chain?**: With the accelerated use of open source, most projects depend on hundreds of open-source dependencies. This poses a security problem: what if the dependencies you're using are vulnerable? You could be putting your users at risk of a supply chain attack. One of the most important things you can do to protect your supply chain is to patch your vulnerable dependencies and replace any malware.

GitHub offers a range of features to help you understand the dependencies in your environment, know about vulnerabilities in those dependencies, and patch them. The supply chain features on GitHub are:

- Dependency graph
- Dependency review
- Dependabot alerts
- Dependabot updates
  - Dependabot security updates
  - Dependabot version updates

**What is a dependency graph**: The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository and any dependencies that are submitted for the repository using the dependency submission API (beta). For each repository, it shows:

- Dependencies, the ecosystems and packages it depends on
- Dependents, the repositories and packages that depend on it

### :keyboard: Activity 1.1: Verify that dependency graph is enabled

**We recommend opening another browser tab to work through the following activities so you can keep these instructions open for reference.**

>[!NOTE]
> Dependency graph is enabled by default for all new public repositories.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
1. Click **Code Security**.
1. Verify **Dependency Graph** is **Enabled**

### :keyboard: Activity 1.2: Add a new dependency and view your dependency graph

1. Navigate to the **Code** tab and locate the `code/src/AttendeeSite` folder.
1. Commit the following content on the `main` branch to the `package-lock.json` file as the last item on the `dependencies` map _(after the third to last bracket `}` and before the last two brackets)_

    > ðŸª§ **Note:** You can edit and commit the file on github.com directly or hit the `.` key to open the lightweight editor to edit and commit changes.

    ```json
    ,
    "follow-redirects": {
      "version": "1.14.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/follow-redirects/-/follow-redirects-1.14.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-HWqDgT7ZEkqRzBvc2s64vSZ/hfOceEol3ac/7tKwzuvEyWx3/4UegXh5oBOIotkGsObyk3xznnSRVADBgWSQVg=="
    }
    ```

1. Navigate to the **Insights** tab.
1. Select **Dependency graph** from the side navigation bar.
1. Review all the dependencies on the **Dependencies** tab.
1. Search for `follow-redirects` and review the new dependency you just added.

1. With the new dependency added, Mona should already be busy checking your work. Give her a moment and keep watch in the comments. You will see her respond with progress info and the next lesson.
